SkyRL Setup

Checked existing project venv (.venv/bin/python is Python 3.12.11) and confirmed uv is already on PATH.
Created the SkyRL training venv with uv venv --python 3.12 ~/venvs/skyrl-train and verified it reports Python 3.12.11.
Pulled the latest ~/SkyRL repo (left the user’s skyrl-train/pyproject.toml.backup untouched) and ran uv sync --active --extra vllm inside the new venv; freed ~31 GB beforehand by clearing old ~/.cache/{pip,uv} to make room.
Started Ray with uv integration (export RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_HOOK=ray._private.runtime_env.uv_runtime_env_hook.hook; ray start --head) and confirmed ray status shows 1 head node idle.
Verified GPU stack in the venv: torch.cuda.is_available() → True, GPU NVIDIA L40S, CUDA runtime 12.8; vllm.__version__ → 0.10.1.1; ray.__version__ → 2.48.0.
Displayed the SkyRL training CLI via python -m skyrl_train.entrypoints.main_base --help (avoids re-downloading gigabyte wheels that uv run --isolated would fetch each time).
Tried the optional pip install -e for skyrl-gym, but the project’s build backend lacks a PEP 660 editable hook; it’s already installed via uv sync.
Note: disk usage remains tight (~4.5 GB free on /); I removed large uv/pip caches to proceed.
Next Steps

Add export RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_HOOK=ray._private.runtime_env.uv_runtime_env_hook.hook to your shell init if you want it persistent, and run ray stop when you’re done.
Install this repo into the SkyRL venv (pip install -e /home/ubuntu/projects/skyrl-mcp-project) once your environment class is ready, then point environment.env_class and dataset paths at it.
Consider reclaiming additional disk space (old virtualenvs, datasets, etc.) or relocating uv caches to keep future installs from exhausting storage.
